I used to have a blindfold to help me fall asleep, back when I was living with 7 other people. We didn't even have our own room or even bed. So 3 people each floor, and all of us had to sleep on the floor with a blanket. Whenever the other guy needed to stay up for whatever reason, he had to let the table lamp on. And the rest of us slept with a blindfold. 

It didn't really helped me with the sleeping. So eventually I just left it aside until I move out to another place. Then I used for meditation practice instead. 

When I first started, the book I read about sitting zen was to just observe whatever pass through my mind and just observe it, focus on the breathing. Me being a little rascal and rebellious, think of all sort of thing. I constructed a whole landscape thingy inside my *headscape*. 

It was sort of fun for a while.

Until I enjoyed it too much.

And I stayed there because I didn't have anyone else. 

And I stayed there because I didn't want anyone else anymore.

What happened and the thing in between aren't worth talking about. But somewhere in that period, I threw the blindfold away and stopped going there for quite a while. 

Then it bled into the real world, the thing in my head and the thing I saw in reality. It's when I realized I depended on it. I can't live without it. 

...

There is this island in the middle of the ocean. I stay there with another person. We wear white costume, and we sit on the sands and watch sunset. It's almost always sunset there unless I need night time. Then the sky would filled with stars. Stars shine brightly, glowing and fading. 

The kind of starscape you could only see in light exposed footage on the Internet. 

The kind of starscape you could only see if you are not in a big city. 

The stars and the moon.

Sometimes I just stay there on the beach. Whenever I just couldn't escape to my usual hiding spot in the real world, I find my shirt and wrap it around my eyes. Then I go to the beach inside.

Sometimes I just stay there on the beach. I stay there and cry.

Because I can't cry anywhere else.

...

Could you stay here with me for a while?
