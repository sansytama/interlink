I daydream often.

…

She was sitting in front of me, what separate us was 2 halves of the table, and a blue glowing spear in the middle of it. There, left side, laid a conveniently rotating plate built-in to the table, she said it allows her to, quote, “holding tea cups for guests in case situation like this ever happens”. I didn’t know what’s funnier, the fact that this “situation” was occurring frequent enough for her to come up and made it into something real, or the damn table to even being rebuilt just to getting broken in half the next time someone paid her a visit. Or even the fact that she didn’t already have a reputation just by this welcoming ritual to guarantee never have any future visit at all.

*ehehe*

…

A minute had passed.

She had this look on me, a look that I can only describe as a mixture of genuine surprise and deep contemplation, while simultaneously trying to stay in both the present and the past. It wasn’t demeaning, nor judging, nor sadness, nor happy. It was a gaze that’s hard to read.

She looked deep into my eyes.

Me, as wondering as ever, seems to daydreamed myself into a conversation that took place inside my head, one that I didn’t even know exist, possessed this person right after they asked her a question which I didn’t even know what in the first place.

…

Another minute had passed.

She slowly took off her eyepatch. 

I then understood her look earlier.

She had an eye under the eyepatch. It was a dark, black eye with a white pupil. It wasn’t pitch black, "deep hole like" quality that has an horizon around the rear socket, with a little white flame like Sans’ eye. Her pupil glowed brightly, as if she took the moon and put it in that eye of her.

…

She smiled a little.

>My eyes are completely fine, just different from one another.
>
>It glows really bright when I’m excited.
>
>…
>
>When I was just a small fry, I had trouble getting along. No one was rude to me, but like, there was this invisible barrier between me and the kids. I didn’t quite get it, but it didn’t make me sad or anything.
>
>One day, there was this theatre performance at school, I got to be the role of a pirate captain because God it looked so cool back then, with the hook and the eyepatch and the wooden sword. Oh did I mention the part where I get to push people off the plank? It was so freaking cool and funny at the same time.
>
> Anyway, the day came, and the performance went well. I get to be this cool kid among the kids, and somehow I got along better. So I kept wearing the eyepatch till this day. Lucky for you I lost my hook somewhere in middle school hahaha!!
> 
> …
	
> But, after a while, it gets itchy you know. Sometimes I just wanna left the thing home and walk around with both my eyes. I did try doing that a few times, but I got too excited I think. It was fun scaring a few kids down the blocks, like I have a flashlight as an eye. But when their parents steps in, and poor Gerson has to explain to them with the kids behind their back. Things started to get a bit out of hands.

> It took me a while to realize that people don’t like it too much when I leave my left eye without the patch. I wish someone would just cut the crap and told me sooner.
> 
> It’s still itchy sometimes.
> 
> …
> 
> Papyrus and I share that, in a strange way, I think.
