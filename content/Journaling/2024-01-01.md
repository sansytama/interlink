I don't write often. I have an annoying way of writing, which I guess anyone could see.

That's not the issue though. This blog is disconnected from most of the outside Internet world. Google doesn't index it, I don't publish nor advertising it. The few people that know this... place exists, they won't read them unless I ask them to. And they are my friends, most of them already tolerate what I am at this point.

So that's not the issue.

What is, then?
