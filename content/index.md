# About me

Truth to be told, I'm **just someone**. There's nothing interesting about me.

I write about whatever was on my mind or stuff that I'm still thinking about here. Though I’m not so much of a writer. What I write here are basically the things I can't tell anyone else in real life. So, just consider this my little escape. My **headspace**. 

That's right, you're in my head right now. Oooooohhhhh..... spooky.......
# Contents

This blog has an [[/Undertale|Undertale]] section in it, and sometimes I write about the story and how its characters mean to me. Otherwise, there are... different things. Feel free to look around.

Please note that most of the things in this blog are my thoughts. Thoughts that written out loud, from a human being. A **nobody** with an opinion, if you will. I can be right in this sentence, and be completely wrong in the next one.

So, as a fellow human being to each other, I hope you understand that and don't take an attitude with towards them.

# Feed
There's a RSS Feed. You can save it so you'd know when I post something new (which isn't often, like a post a week top)
