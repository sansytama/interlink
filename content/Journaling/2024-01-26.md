I don't trust often. It's a high risk game and rewards are rare sights.

It's a big city, one filled to the brim with all the people from every corner of the country, cramp into a giant vortex of chaos that spun itself aimlessly towards "a new future", or at least that's what they said. I question this "future" everyday, specially when I stand in the red light. Where the ugliness of the daily people came to be.

Anyway. "**trust**".

The more I try to trust someone for a certain work, the more disappointed I am with the quality of work they give me. Sometimes there is no work at all and I'm left to deal with the mess they abandon. While I acknowledge the fact trust is necessary in any line of works, otherwise there would be no progress towards anything because no one can do everything alone. It is really hard to trust and have the expected result in a city where personal benefit is put above ethical actions and incompetent personnel thinking they can do more good than harm. One is selfish desire, the other is hell on Earth.

It is hell, because the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
