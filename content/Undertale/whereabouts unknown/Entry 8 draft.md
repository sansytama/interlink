The **Metamorphic Terrestrial Temperature** system (MTT), designed by the former Head Scientist Dr. ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇, was a deeply complex Earth's season simulation system that spanned all across from Snowdin, all the way to New Home. Although the first draft and prototype of this design were rough, it was truly a pinnacle achievement that utilized both science and magic together. Combined with the CORE, it was designed with many purposes in mind. 

The first days were the hardest, to solve the dire *Energy* problem, The first CORE transforms lava into power using geothermal process. Early draft showed a huge amount of water from the main subterranean river to reach efficiency conversion of merely 6%. It was enough for a while, until they ran out of water to effectively grew crops while maintaining water supply for the Underground citizens at the same time. And on top of that, the heat and steams produced in the process affected negatively almost every single monsters.

So the Magical Research and Science Research team worked together. And thus, the **MTT** System was made. First, a number of tubes and multilayered chambers was installed deep below the ground of the area of where Snowdin is now. A spell of condensing was used to to reach very high level of compression inside the hardened chambers with **Titanium Alloy** and Aerogel coating outside to create maximum efficiency. For the next step, a steady water supply was needed. So, they split a small part of the main stream for Waterfall to supply the water to the chambers. 

Even with all that, they still needed a kickstart environment.

On Chapter 5 "*UNBEING"*, page 66, the 2nd paragraph from the book "*Azur's notes of the calling VOID*," two monsters with Fire type were required to be "as one" to perform the specific ordered set of spells. They were instructed to stand inside both round part of the chalk drew number 8. Both had to wear a pair of black rings and chanting at 8 seconds apart from each other. That process turned both of them into a single monster, the "Negative Fire". With black flame and white edges, the property of their flames seemed to rob away heat from its surrounding, where the heat absorbed transfer to or to what form it took was not conclusive. Nevertheless, they worked quickly with the new... mean of achievement to get the isolated regional temperature reach 10 degree F.

A long process of
