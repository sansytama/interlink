Rocks falling down endlessly from the small flowing waterfall, sounded almost in sync with each plops to the small platform where I was standing. Despite that, they didn't seem to be stuck at the bottom of the water flow. Each of them spin and dance happily with each other, before falling down to the endless abyss that 2 steps away.

Bloop, plop, drip drip, splash, plop, clak, burble burble, drip drip, murmur, plop plop... Tappy tappy on the flow, plopping plopping gentle on the surface. 

Gentle dripping of droplets from the ceiling, gentle water stream flowing through the creeks. Gently running down, on the smoothed surface with the stream of rocks falling still.  

I didn't have to go way far in to see how magical Waterfall is.

...

Shining crystals with shade of blue, gentle hue of amethyst, dimly touch of emerald green,... All blended together like an endless stream of stardust at the reach of my hands. 

Shining shining, shining stars. 

Fade in, fade out, gently fade. 

Fade in fade out, gently gone. 

Like clear night sky of summers day.

Like millions of hope and dreams wished everyday.

[[Entry 6|Like million pieces of scattered souls.]]

Fade in, fade out, gently fade. 

Fade in, fade out, gently gone. 

...

I stood here sometimes.

I heard passing conversations sometimes, too.
