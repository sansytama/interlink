I daydream often.

There was this one time, when I was walking down the street, I suddenly lost inside my own head. I was at the Ruin’s door.

It was snowing. I’ve never seen snow before, much less wanting to wonder how could snow falls inside a cave. But it was peaceful. I walked around feeling light, freely like a spirit. I saw Sans at the sentry station. He didn’t doze off or sleeping, just laid there. His socket eyes half open, his skeletal hand reached out to catch the snow fell. And the snow slowly fell, on the tip of his nasal bone.

He didn’t see me.

It was quiet. It was like that for a while. It was like a moment stretched to a lifetime.

And I got teleported back to where I was standing, the street.
