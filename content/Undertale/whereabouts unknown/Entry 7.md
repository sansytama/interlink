I daydream often. I still do.

...

It was an afternoon.

The train was a really old model even by the standard of old. It was on course of moving from north to south cities. There were 2 rows of seats, but each seat was more like a wooden bench than an actual seat, you could fit 3 people in it, either that or a really uh... "plus sized" people. It wasn't really an exaggeration when I say I've seen 5 people on one before. That bounded to happen if you were to have a ticket to go anywhere on holiday. Lucky for me, there weren't any plus-sized people that day. In fact, there were barely anyone took that train.

The sun dipped its lower half onto the sea that runs forever to the horizon, like it was cooling off itself to take the role of become the moon, rather than lending the role to the real one. The upper half reflected perfectly on the water surface, while the reflection dancing wiggly with the waves. For a moment, it was like the sky came down to us, as if I could touch it if I were outside. As if the sun wanted to shake hands with us, using its beam of late day sunlight shone warmingly on those clouds' edges, as its own way to reach out.

...

The skeleton brothers were next to me.

Papyrus sat close to the window. There were light on his eyes, as he set his gaze far away to the horizon. The light of sunsets, the light of excitement, the light of his magical flame pupil. All of them danced together harmoniously, like how the shade of azure blue,, violet, and tangerine danced in the sky, on the ocean.

There is something beautiful about sunset that never fails to rob me from whatever I deemed to be important at time. The sunset always seems to me, like how the sun is trying to say goodbye, before went out to say hello to people on the others side of Earth. 

Heh, funny. “Goodbye”. 

He said that once, too, “GOODBYES AREN'T ALLOWED IN MY TOWN. JUST SEE-YOU-LATERS”

Each day, each time I wake up. The sun is there again, shining still. But it isn't really the same, is it? Each day the sun comes out anew, remakes itself anew, comes with new lights, shines new lights on us, gives us a new day, and goes out to the horizon just to starts the process all over again.

Should I say goodbye, or should I say see you later? 

For sunlight to reach Earth, it would have to take 7 minutes or so, through the vacuum of spaces, through the thick atmosphere that filters out most space radiation and UV rays, to finally, reach the surface. The past of the sun seems to be the present of our lives, in a sense. We only see what has already happened. Everywhere we see, we couldn't help but seeing the past.

Every moment, our bodies create new cells that replace old cells. Every moment our minds take in new information and produce new thoughts, create new meaning. We die and reborn in every moment. Yet for some reason, each day, the majority of us go out and do the same thing, go through the same routines, stuck in the same place. For some reason, we'd rather look at what the person of yesterday and make them the person that exist today. For some reason, the person in the past is more important the the person in the now.

Like for some reason, the only thing we could see, are the past of each other. 

Like for some reason, the only thing we could see, are the past of everything. Just that sometimes, the differences are so indescribably small, we never seem to notice. 

Like how we never seem to notice how each day, the sun shines new light. 

Like how each day, it's a new day. 

Like how yesterday and tomorrow should've been different from today.

...

Sans laid himself peacefully by his brother's side. Despite all the bumping, all the noises of the railway, he laid there sleeping. It was almost quiet.

For a brief moment, I considered reaching out to his hands. But I know better. There was a reason they could never see me. The same reason I could never reach out to them no matter how much I wanted to.

Like a [[Entry 4|picture in the hallway]], it always looked beautiful. So beautiful, you couldn't help but keeping it out of touch. For it to never being ruined, by the touch of hands, by the touch of strangers, by the touch of time. Forever, there, you wanted the past to live on.

I, too, for that moment, wanted it to live on. To hold it to the present, just for a little longer. 

That moment, right there and then. It was like a picture. 

The picture in the Hallway of Fleeting Moments.
