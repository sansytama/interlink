This is my effort to make something, I don't know what it is yet, but I'll find out along the way.

Built using Quartz by Jacky Zhao and his community. It's pretty cool. Checkout his repo [here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git) and how you can make your own [here](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).

Thanks, Jacky.
