Sometimes I ponder on what words should I use when I interact with people. It's necessary for me, I'm not so much of a *people* person. They scare me. But they are also deeply fascinating, to me at least.

The other day, I was thinking about these two phrases, ones that are most commonly use, and also the most... condensed sentences we tell each other. The first is a question, the second is the answer. It takes many forms and sometimes use different words. But boiled down, they're like this:

> **The Question:** "Are you okay?"
> 
> **And the Answer:** "I am okay."

It's a simple question, by asking "Are you okay?", most of us certainly come from a genuine place of concern, we want to know the state of the questionee's well being. 

It's a simple answer, by saying "I am okay", the person being asked express their state or well being as a direct respond to the question. Their well being is doing well.

...

But of course, it's not that simple. Nothing is ever that simple.

Because the question is heavily context dependent. The answer is also, more often than not, a lie.

A sweet, little lie.

...

When I was really young, my grandpa was standing in his garden when me and my family came visit my grandparents. I stood with him for a while, we were watching the rose bushes. White roses. I don't remember exactly who asked, but someone asked him if he was alright. "I'm fine.", he responded in a strange voice. A voice that was different from how he normally talks. He then went on and explain cool facts about roses to me, while holding a cigarette in his hand. Then all of the sudden, the conversation steered into how I should look after my parents, and listen to them when they tell me what to do, and to do well in school,... To boil it down, he wanted to make sure I would do well from that point on.

It was as if those were his last words. 

And turned out, those were his last words to me.

I got busy with school and my parents were also busy. Busier than usual. I didn't see him until my parents took me to visit him on his last day. He was barely conscious.

I stayed by his side.

He passed away the day after. Throat cancer. He kept it a secret until his last few months when the symptoms couldn't be hidden anymore. 

He didn't want to bother anyone, he told my grandma when she found out about his symptoms.

"I'm fine." He said.

...

In time, in retrospection, I sort of get it. I sort of understand *why*.

Because I too do the same thing, one way or another.

I know when my parents ask if I am okay, it comes from a genuine place. A place of unconditional love that comes naturally in most people who become a parent. That they noticed something was off about me. 

I know when sometimes a friend meeting each other, they often ask each other ***if each of them are doing well***.  If they weren't that close, then the question sort of serves as social pleasantry. A way to break the ice and more to have a subconscious agreement to openness. To bore each other with niceness without letting the facade slips. To warm-up before they getting to know more as time move forward. A warm-up. An exchange of two ways, like a handshake.

If these friends know each other to a certain degree, a friendship that one could consider close. The question bends a little bit. It of course still comes from a genuine place, but there's a lot of subtext in it. It has the genuineness, the same quality as of the parents, while also directly acknowledge the relationship of each other. 

You ask your friends because you **KNOW** they are unwell. You might understand them all too well. But you also know the barrier between you and them, no matter how close you both are. So you ask, not because you want to know. But because you want them to be honest. 

"Are you okay?" more or less, means...

> I already know the answer, I know you are **NOT** okay, I just don't know ***why***. I just don't know ***what happened***. 
> 
> I can't force you to share, nor can I barge into your life with the idiocy kind of thinking I could solve this problem for you. But please talk to me. Please unburden yourself.
> 
> Just for this one, don't be the mask.

It's a foolish thinking. Flawed with idealistic thinking your position in their life could all change the situation with kindness. The flawed thinking you also very much well aware.

We all aware this on some level.

It's human, all too human.
