- Sans and Papyrus are originally the skeletons of two first humans that fell down the Underground. Those two human died when two powerful magician confronted and killed them, and also died on their corpses as well. The dusts spread on their corpses buried for many years before W. D. Gaster dug them out and start experimenting on them. Created 2 monsters skeleton. This makes Gaster their surrogate father, but not a skeleton on his own.
