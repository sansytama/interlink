I daydream often.

I once got lost in a train of thought, or rather, a series of scenario that never really happened. But it felt real nonetheless.

There was a kid climbing a mountain. They were so little, they were so alone. Why did a child climb a mountain in a sunset all alone by themself? I don’t know, no one know, even the child didn’t know. Maybe someone was once by their side, and then that person went away. Maybe it went on like that for a while. Maybe the child picked that up and do the same. “It is said that those who climb the mountain never return”. So the child ran, Just ran away. Up, up and away. Then way down the child went. And way down they went.

…

There was a picture in the hallway, the happy Dreemurr’s family, the perfect Dreemurr family, with perfect smiles, a perfect son, and a perfectly peaceful kingdom. They’ve had kind eyes, the kind of eyes the were so strange to the purview of your normal day human person, but warmer than anything they’ve ever experienced.

The child later on learnt what happened to the good monsterkind down there. Those were the happiest day of the human child, spending in that hole that they once thought were destined to give them salvation.

…

It was a beautiful day outside, a child climbed a mountain alone.

It was a beautiful day outside, a monster with the corpse of a human child in its arms, climbed down the mountain.

It was a beautiful day outside, the 7th child climbed the mountain.

It was a beautiful day outside, all monsters were given freedom.

It was a beautiful day outside, all monsters’ hope left lied on the argument of a single monster that has 1HP.

It was a century ago. It was a decade ago. It was a few days ago. What was old, hurts just like it was just yesterday.

It’s always just a beautiful day like that, like another billions days on earth. It’s just like our cries for help, and nobody came.

…

I missed the green light 2 times.
