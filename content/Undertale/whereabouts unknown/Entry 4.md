...

The picture was in the hallway. It was the picture of the Dreemurr family. The happy Dreemurr family, the perfect Dreemurr family. They had gentle smiles. 

A single beam of sunlight from the ceiling troubled itself all its way through the small hole in the cave ceiling, through the front window of the Queen's house, shine weakly on the glass frame. The frame was pristine clean, as if someone took their time to clean it, almost meticulously, every day. Each places of the Ruins beamed owith colours and life, as if it was just yesterday when most of its citizens still live here.

The Queen sat by the flowerbed with her eyes closed, doze off on a folding chair, with a bird on her horn. It was as if time froze for a while, as I stood there for a bit, looking at her. It was like that for the rest of the day, like every day since that happened.

...

The picture was in the hallway. It was the picture of the Dreemurr family. The happy Dreemurr family, the perfect Dreemurr family. They had kind eyes.

There was a thin layer of dust and fur on the glass. There were scratches on the lower left corner of the picture inside, covered sloppily by transparent tapes together. The layout seems to be the same of the Queen house, yet it made itself clear enough to everyone that this place was meant to keep the body survive, but not the owner's soul. I continue on, hearing my own breath. 

There was no sunlight here, despite being the highest and nearest to the top of the mountain. The stern looking Froggits and the tall looking monsters with armors from head to toe stood guard, just few meters from each other. 

The King was watering flowers inside the Throne Room. Lights shone through the room's ceiling, forming 7 petals of Golden Flower on the flowerbed around the throne. Despite that, it felt cold, uncaring and burning at the same time. The sound of birds singing while there was none to be seen. “Nice day today!”, he wrote on the journal full of that same line, every day since that happened.

...

The King and Queen, wake up on the same time every day, going on the same routines, waiting for the same thing, every single day. Each of them waited for the chance to redeem themselves, as a human come, every single day. One obsessively thinking about making a future, the other desperately try keeping the past from disappearing. 

Each of them, before going into their room, gaze into the front of each other's bedroom door, just for a while, as if someone was there. Just for a brief moment, hoping inside, they could see each other.
