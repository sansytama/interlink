Is it?  

Is it okay?  

Why? Why yes? Why not?  

Is it right? Is it right, considering you? Is it right, considering them?

----------

Is the whole building on fire, or is it just your apartment?  

What if there's rescue behind the curtain of smoke and flames?  

It's the worst thing when sheer terror overcomes you. But one choice is a maybe. One is definite  

There's always hope. Hold on to hope

RE: (by me)

A firefighter trapped in a burning house. What did he do?

Like a silent picture. He watched the silent fires burn around him.

The apartment is on fire,

the building is on fire.

[Everything is burning,](https://parabola.org/2022/10/30/everything-is-burning/)

everything is on fire.

Everything is dissatisfaction 

in the end.

For a drunkard that is thirsty even with all boozes this world could offer,

what is hope?
