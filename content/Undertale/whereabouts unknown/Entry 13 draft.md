I woke up in a state of confusion, surrounded by... 

...nothing.

A thin, blurry white line stretches across the horizon, glowing faintly to the upper half in the landscape of black nothingness. The only sense of direction I had. Up, and down where I stood.

Cold.

Uncaring.

Ear drums ring to a song of high pitch *lullaby*, a perpetuity of emptiness ringing, begetting more of the same, same.

The default state of nothingness out of thin air, where sounds produced just to feed into the streaming madness of pointless imagination. The sound of blackness static in high band. Out of nothing.

Made me think of a study. Participants were put in a room with only two choices: sitting with their thoughts for 15 minutes, or press a button for electric shock. 

Most people choose to shock themselves.

...

A dark grey door casts a faint shadow, holding onto its frame with no wall surrounding.

I peek my head to the side of the door frame. Nothing. Or, nothing out of the ordinary, at least. One would assume that would be just... it.

A minute seemed like an hour in the place where you have nothing to feed by your own thoughts. 

The door made a crackling sound as its mechanic turn inside.
